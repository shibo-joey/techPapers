  ### Buy more machine - Horizontal scaling
  - Load Banlancing required
  - Data inconsistency
  - Add unit to break the limitation of hardware
  
  ###  Buy more powerful machine - Vertical scaling
  - No Load Banlancing required
  - Data consistent
  - Hardware limitation

# Monolithic and Microservice Architecture
  ### Monolithic
  - Monolithic does not mean single machine
  - Hard to explain to new team member
  - Hard to deploy
  - Too much responsibililty on each server
  
  
  ### Microservice
  - Easy to scale
  - Easy for new team member
  - parallel developing is more easy
  - Need a good architecture
