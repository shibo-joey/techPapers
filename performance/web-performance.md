### 1. Server Response (TTFB)
- Use CDNs for static content and edge caching.
- Implement server-side caching for repeatable responses.
- Optimize backend logic to reduce Time to First Byte (TTFB).
- Enable response compression (gzip or brotli).

### 2. HTML Parsing & Render Start
- Minify and streamline initial HTML.
- Inline critical CSS to render above-the-fold content quickly.
- Remove render-blocking resources early in the document.

### 3. Asset Loading (CSS, JS, Images)
- Apply code splitting (e.g., via Webpack or Vite).
Use lazy loading for images and non-critical components.
Set defer/async on non-blocking scripts.
Serve images in modern formats (WebP, AVIF).
Use font-display: swap to avoid invisible text.

### 4. JS Execution & Hydration
Minimize and tree-shake JavaScript.
Consider partial hydration (React Server Components or Islands Architecture).
Avoid long main thread tasks; move heavy logic to Web Workers.

### 5. Rendering & Painting
Avoid layout thrashing (batch DOM reads/writes).
Use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity) for animations.
Defer non-critical rendering via requestIdleCallback or lazy loading.

### 6. Interactivity & UX
Debounce or throttle event handlers.
Preload/prefetch future navigation routes (Next.js or React Router).
Monitor and optimize Core Web Vitals:
LCP (load speed)
FID (input responsiveness)
CLS (layout shift)

### 7. Observability & Continuous Monitoring
Use Lighthouse and WebPageTest during development.
Add real-user monitoring (RUM) with tools like Sentry or New Relic.
Track Core Web Vitals in production (e.g., via Google Analytics v4 or custom logs).
