🖥️ 1. Server Response (TTFB)
Use CDNs for static content and edge caching.

Implement server-side caching for repeatable responses.

Optimize backend logic to reduce Time to First Byte (TTFB).

Enable response compression (gzip or brotli).

🧾 2. HTML Parsing & Render Start
Minify and streamline initial HTML.

Inline critical CSS to render above-the-fold content quickly.

Remove render-blocking resources early in the document.

🧩 3. Asset Loading (CSS, JS, Images)
Apply code splitting (e.g., via Webpack or Vite).

Use lazy loading for images and non-critical components.

Set defer/async on non-blocking scripts.

Serve images in modern formats (WebP, AVIF).

Use font-display: swap to avoid invisible text.

⚙️ 4. JS Execution & Hydration
Minimize and tree-shake JavaScript.

Consider partial hydration (React Server Components or Islands Architecture).

Avoid long main thread tasks; move heavy logic to Web Workers.

🖌️ 5. Rendering & Painting
Avoid layout thrashing (batch DOM reads/writes).

Use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity) for animations.

Defer non-critical rendering via requestIdleCallback or lazy loading.

🧠 8. Interactivity & UX
Debounce or throttle event handlers.

Preload/prefetch future navigation routes (Next.js or React Router).

Monitor and optimize Core Web Vitals:

LCP (load speed)

FID (input responsiveness)

CLS (layout shift)

📊 9. Observability & Continuous Monitoring
Use Lighthouse and WebPageTest during development.

Add real-user monitoring (RUM) with tools like Sentry or New Relic.

Track Core Web Vitals in production (e.g., via Google Analytics v4 or custom logs).
