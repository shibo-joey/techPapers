# Three main components of redux
---

# Store

- Hold the state of your application.
- Allows access to state via getState()
- Allows state to be updated via dispatch(action)
- Registers listeners via subscribe(Listener)

```javascript
import redux from "redux"
import { createStore } from 'redux'

const store = createStore(reducer)

```
- Combine multiple reducers

```javascript
import redux,{ createStore } from "redux"
import { combineReducers } from 'redux'

const rootRducer = combineReducers({
  name1:  reducer1,
  name2:  reducer2
})

const store = createStore(rootRducer)

```

# Action

- Describe the change in the state of the application.

```javascript
function actionCreator(){
  return  {
      type: ACTION_NAME
  }
}
```

# Reducer

- Specify how the app's state changes in response to actions sent to store.

```javascript
// (previousState, action) => newState

const initialState = {
  numState: 0
}

const reducer = (state=initialState, action) => {
  switch(action.type){
    case ACTION_NAME: return{
      ...state,
      numState: state.numState + 1
    }
    default: return state
  }
}
```


# Principles
---

- The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.
- The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
- To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers
